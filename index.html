<h1>HCI Project 2</h1>
<h2>by Ayo, Frank, Sidney, and Shelby</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Education is one of the largest contributors to socioeconomic inequality. Poor education within low-income communities perpetuates the wealth 
gap and halts social mobility. For this reason, we decided it would be meaningful to look at the disparities between educational outcomes and 
resources public school students receive. We wanted to be empirical in our approach, so we quantified resources with spending per pupil and 
teacher salary and success with test scores and graduation rates. While we recognize many qualitative factors go into the “success” of a school, 
we decided to explorethe numbers, and let the data speak for itself.
