<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It was hard to find correlations between the variables we looked at.</p>
<p>Clear inequality in the resources of the public education in each state (money, salaries) and the different measures of success (standardized test scores, graduation rates).</p>
<p>Demographic data and spending also vary within each state. A breakdown of the counties and school districts in Maryland for example may have shown different results. For example, within a state wealthier school districts are funded better because of property tax and even though there is policy intended to give more money to poorer districts, the way money is allotted still results in a huge disparity in funding. Numerous examples comparing districtâ€™s tax rates, spending per student and money received from the government highlight this finding (Kozol 1991). </p>
